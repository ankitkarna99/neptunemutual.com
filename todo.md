## Tasks
[ ] Replace portfolio app webp images with inline svg icons to reduce network requests
[ ] Replace investor background images with inline svg icons as well
[ ] Blog and pressroom tags should also add hash to the href
[ ] Use `err` instead of `error`. We need to avoid using acronyms ever. `err` in itself is a word which is very similar to `error` but still has a different meaning

Replace

`max-width: 375` to `max-width: 374`
`max-width: 425` to `max-width: 424`
`max-width: 768px` to `max-width: 767px`
`max-width: 1024` to `max-width: 1023`
`max-width: 1440px` to `max-width: 1439px`
`max-width: 2560px` to `max-width: 2559px`


## Breakpoints:

There is a problem with Google Chrome's approach of jumping from 425px directly to 768px
Many of the mobile device fall between these two breakpoints.
