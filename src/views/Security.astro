    Here at Neptune Mutual, we value security and protection highly. We have
    spent a lot of time and resource doing code reviews of our smart contracts,
    frontend, and backend. We have security firms that we deal with on a regular
    basis to do security review and penetration testing on our hosting systems
    and applications. In addition, we have a stringent cyber hygiene policy that
    everyone must follow.
